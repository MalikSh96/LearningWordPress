# About featured images
A featured image is a single image that we choose to represent a post or a page,
whereas a regular image is something we add in the text area of the post.\

A featured image is a hands-off approach when it comes where you think the image should be located,
we don't get to choose that. We are basically saying that you will let your theme make intelligent design choices for you.
We just assign the image to represent the given post/page.\

A featured image is a separate field from the main text of your post/page, which allows your theme to do very dynamic things.\
